# Create Course Directory/Folder System
This is a short script that lets you create folders for a course.

## Brief Outline
1. Select which folder you would like all of the other folders to be based in.
2. Name your first folder.
3. Answer questions about what kind of sub-folders you would like (i.e. a folder for a formula sheet, homework assignments, etc.).
4. Press 'q' to quit the program, or let the program finish running itself. You can press 'q' at any time as well.

## Example
Let's say that we have a folder titled "senior_year_s1" for the first semester of our senior year. We're taking some classes and want to create a file folder for each class. The way this program is set up is the following:

![program_flow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54254899/210276665-98995d4b-bd9d-4fe9-9db5-38f959f924f1.png)

In our example here, "senior_year_s1" would be the "Main Folder", which is the folder you select at the beginning of the program. After that, the program asks you to name your next folder. This is going to be the name of your class, so something like "english" or "calculus".

1. Here, "senior_year_s1" would be the "Main Folder", which is the folder you select at the beginning of the program using your mouse and keyboard.
2. This is going to be the name of your class, so something like "english" or "calculus".
3. The program can create as many copies of homework or lab files that you would like, using the naming convention in the diagram, which is "hw_#", where "#" is the homework number. So if you put 5 for the number of homeworks, the homework folder will have five sub-folder, "hw_1", "hw_2", etc. up to "hw_5". The same system is used for the labs, with the prefix "lab" instead of "hw".
4. You can press the 'q' key on your keyboard to quit the program at any time, or you can go through the entire program and let it run to completion. The program will tell you when it has finished running.
